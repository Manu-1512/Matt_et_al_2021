This is a simultaneous analysis of genes and Transposable elements (TEs) from 10X data, using the lovain clustering. We performed the analysis using “Alevin” as a tool integrated with the salmon software that uses EM algorithms for the analysis of 3’ tagged-end single-cell sequencing data.

First code named ```Preparing_files_for_Alevin_bash.sh``` is step-wise codes where we indexed the concatenated genes and TEs transcriptome and genome reference file using salmon.
